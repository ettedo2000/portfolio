/*I started working on Basic HTML Web Design in 2008 quickly realizing my passion for Web Design and Development. In 2011 I decided to pursue a Associate Degree in Computer Science at Northeast State Community College in Blountville TN to take my passion to a professional level. I graduated in 2014 with a double Major in Internet and Web Development and Computer Programming.

	Since than I been working full time as a Web Developer maintaining, designing and developing websites. My work ranges from front-end designs(HTML, Java Script, JQuery, CSS, SCSS, Bootstrap, Vuejs and Angular), to back-end developments(PHP, Payment Portals, API, Ajax). I also work as a freelance Web Designer and have worked on several projects that include Word Press, Drupal and Pay Pal.
